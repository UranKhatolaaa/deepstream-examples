This document describes the procedure to generate plan engine files and run
Triton Inference Server samples on TensorRT, Tensorflow, ONNX, Pytorch models.

On dGPU platforms, these samples are meant to be executed inside DeepStream's
Triton Inference Server container.
On Jetson platforms, these samples are meant to be executed on target device
directly or inside DeepStream L4T container.
For DeepStream containers, please refer to the DeepStream Quick Start Guide
for instructions on pulling the container image and starting the container.
Once the DeepStream Triton environment is ready, run the following commands:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparing classification video samples.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install ffmpeg. It is a pre-requisite to run the next step.
   $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

2. Preparing video samples.
   Go to samples directory and run the following command to generate classification
   video stream at samples/streams/classification_test_video.mp4
   $ ./prepare_classification_test_video.sh

Notes:
   Users can also copy their own classification video files to the same location
   instead of these steps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparing TensorRT, Tensorflow, ONNX models
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to samples directory and run the following command.
   $ ./prepare_ds_trtis_model_repo.sh
   All the sample models should be downloaded/generated into
   samples/trtis-model-repo directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the Triton Inference Server samples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Run the following command to inspect nvinferserver plugin installed successfully.
   $ gst-inspect-1.0 nvinferserver
2. Run the following command to start the app.
   $ deepstream-app -c <path to source....txt>
     e.g. $ deepstream-app -c source1_primary_classifier.txt
3. Application config files included in `configs/deepstream-app-trtis/`
   a. source30_1080p_dec_infer-resnet_tiled_display_int8.txt (30 Decode + Infer)
   b. source4_1080p_dec_infer-resnet_tracker_sgie_tiled_display_int8.txt
      (4 Decode + Infer + SGIE + Tracker)
   c. source1_primary_classifier.txt (Single source + full frame classification)
      NOTE: Other classification models can be used by changing the nvinferserver
            config file in the [*-gie] group of application config file.
   d. source1_primary_detector.txt (Single source + object detection using ssd)
   e. source1_primary_classifier_nano.txt (Single source + full frame classification)
      NOTE: Classification config file for Nano since memory might not be enough for
            other models. Tune a larger 'tf_gpu_memory_fraction' value for other
            platforms.
   f. source1_primary_detector_nano.txt (Single source + object detection using ssd)
      NOTE: Detection config file for Nano since memory might not be enough for
            other models. Tune a larger 'tf_gpu_memory_fraction' value for other
            platforms.
   On certain platforms, model inference might not be in realtime and frames get
   dropped, in that case, edit source...txt file and update 'sync=0' in [sink..] group.
4. Configuration files for "nvinferserver" element in `configs/deepstream-app-trtis/`
   a. config_infer_plan_engine_primary.txt (Primary Object Detector)
   b. config_infer_secondary_plan_engine_carcolor.txt (Secondary Car Color Classifier)
   c. config_infer_secondary_plan_engine_carmake.txt (Secondary Car Make Classifier)
   d. config_infer_secondary_plan_engine_vehicletypes.txt (Secondary Vehicle Type Classifier)
   e. config_infer_primary_classifier_densenet_onnx.txt (DenseNet-121 v1.2 classifier)
   f. config_infer_primary_classifier_inception_graphdef_postprocessInTrtis.txt
      (Tensorflow Inception v3 classifier - Post processing in Triton)
   g. config_infer_primary_classifier_inception_graphdef_postprocessInDS.txt
      (Tensorflow Inception v3 classifier - Post processing in DeepStream)
   h. config_infer_primary_detector_ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.txt
      (TensorFlow SSD Inception V2 Object Detector)
   i. config_infer_primary_classifier_mobilenet_v1_graphdef.txt
      (Tensorflow Mobilenet v1 classifier for Nano - Post processing in Triton)
   j. config_infer_primary_detector_ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2018_01_28.txt
      (TensorFlow SSD Mobilenet V1 Object Detector for Nano)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. If the application runs into errors, cannot create gst elements, try again
after removing gstreamer cache
   rm ${HOME}/.cache/gstreamer-1.0/registry.x86_64.bin
2. When running TensorFlow models using Triton Inference Server, the GPU device
memory may fall short. The allowed GPU device memory allocation for TensorFlow
models can be tuned using the 'tf_gpu_memory_fraction' parameter in the
nvdsinferserver's config files (config_infer_*). A larger value would reserve
more GPU memory for TensorFlow per process, it is possible to have better
performance but may also cause Out-Of-Memory or even core dump. The suggested
value range is [0.2, 0.6].
3. When running deepstream for first time, the following warning might show up:
   "GStreamer-WARNING: Failed to load plugin '...libnvdsgst_inferserver.so':
    libtrtserver.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
This is a harmless warning indicating that the DeepStream's nvinferserver plugin
cannot be used since "Triton Inference Server" is not installed.
If required, try DeepStream's Triton docker image or install the Triton Inference
Server manually. For more details, refer to https://github.com/NVIDIA/triton-inference-server.
4. When running Tensorflow Inception_V3 and SSD_Inception_V2 models on Nano,
update config.pbtxt files in samples/trtis_modeo_repo subdirectories accordingly to
switch to CPU instances since memory is not good enough for GPU instances.
5. When running each Tensorflow/Onnx model in GPU instance. It is optional to
enable TensorRT acceleration. Uncomment optimization{} block in each model's
config.pbtxt file under samples/trtis_modeo_repo subdirectory. It might take several
minutes generate TensorRT online caches during intialization.
6. To learn more details of each parameter, go to section "Gst-nvinferserver" in
   https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/plugin-manual/index.html
